# Handling RunTime Permission In Android Marshmallow 6.0

In Android 5.0 Lolipop and later version, application will be granted any permission at installation time. But in Android 6.0 Marshmallow and above, application has to ask user for a permission one-by-one at runtime, not at installation time. Permission request will not be used by only adding permission tag in Manifast file. Developer has to call a code for handling permission at run time. If it is not called, application will be crashed. 

In this Project, You will find a code for handling multiple permission in android application in easy way. As an example, Message sending and call permissions are taken.
